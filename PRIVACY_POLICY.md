# Notify: Privacy policy
**Welcome to Notify app for Android!**

This is an open source Android app developed by Aleix Soler. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information, for that reason no information is collected.
